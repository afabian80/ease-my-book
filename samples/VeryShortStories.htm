<h2><a name="MASTER_WILLIE" id="MASTER_WILLIE"></a>MASTER WILLIE.</h2>


<p>There was once a little boy called Willie. I
never knew his other name, and as he lived
far off behind the mountain, we cannot go to inquire.
He had fair hair and blue eyes, and there was something
in his face that, when you had looked at him,
made you feel quite happy and rested, and think
of all the things you meant to do by-and-by when
you were wiser and stronger. He lived all alone
with the tall aunt, who was very rich, in the big
house at the end of the village. Every morning he
went down the street with his little goat under his
arm, and the village folk looked after him and
said, "There goes Master Willie."</p>

<p>The tall aunt had a very long neck; on the top of
it was her head, on the top of her head she wore a
white cap. Willie used often to look up at her and
think that the cap was like snow upon the mountain.
She was very fond of Willie, but she had lived a
great many years and was always sitting still to think
them over, and she had forgotten all the games she
used to know, all the stories she had read
when she was little, and when Willie asked her
about them, would say, "No, dear, no, I can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
remember; go to the woods and play." Sometimes
she would take his face between her two hands and
look at him well while Willie felt quite sure that she
was not thinking of him, but of someone else he did
not know, and then she would kiss him, and turn
away quickly, saying, "Go to the woods, dear; it
is no good staying with an old woman." Then he,
knowing that she wanted to be alone, would pick
up his goat and hurry away.</p>

<p>He had had a dear little sister, called Apple-blossom,
but a strange thing had happened to her.
One day she over-wound her very big doll that
talked and walked, and the consequence was quite
terrible. No sooner was the winding-up key out
of the doll's side than it blinked its eyes, talked
very fast, made faces, took Apple-blossom by the
hand, saying, "I am not your doll any longer, but you
are my little girl," and led her right away no one
could tell whither, and no one was able to follow.
The tall aunt and Willie only knew that she had
gone to be the doll's little girl in some strange
place, where dolls were stronger and more
important than human beings.</p>

<p>After Apple-blossom left him, Willie had only his
goat to play with; it was a poor little thing with no
horns, no tail and hardly any hair, but still he
loved it dearly, and put it under his arm every
morning while he went along the street.</p>

<p>"It is only made of painted wood and a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
hair, Master Willie," said the blacksmith's wife one
day. "Why should you care for it; it is not even
alive."</p>

<p>"But if it were alive, anyone could love it."</p>

<p>"And living hands made it," the miller's wife
said. "I wonder what strange hands they were;take
care of it for the sake of them, little master."</p>

<p>"Yes, dame, I will," he answered gratefully, and
he went on his way thinking of the hands, wondering
what tasks had been set them to do since they
fashioned the little goat. He stayed all day in the
woods helping the children to gather nuts and
blackberries. In the afternoon he watched them
go home with their aprons full; he looked after
them longingly as they went on their way singing.
If he had had a father and mother, or brothers
and sisters, to whom he could have carried home
nuts and blackberries, how merry he would have
been. Sometimes he told the children how happy
they were to live in a cottage with the door open all
day, and the sweet breeze blowing in, and the cocks
and hens strutting about outside, and the pigs
grunting in the styes at the end of the garden; to
see the mother scrubbing and washing, to know
that the father was working in the fields, and to
run about and help and play, and be cuffed and
kissed, just as it happened. Then they would
answer, "But you have the tall lady for your aunt,
and the big house to live in, and the grand carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to drive in, while we are poor, and sometimes have
little to eat and drink; mother often tells us how
fine it must be to be you."</p>

<p>"But the food that you eat is sweet because you
are very hungry," he answered them, "and no one
sorrows in your house. As for the grand carriage,
it is better to have a carriage if your heart is
heavy, but when it is light, then you can run swiftly
on your own two legs." Ah, poor Willie, how lonely
he was, and yet the tall aunt loved him dearly.
On hot drowsy days he had many a good sleep with
his head resting against her high thin shoulders,
and her arms about him.</p>

<p>One afternoon, clasping his goat as usual, he
sat down by the pond. All the children had gone
home, so he was quite alone, but he was glad to
look at the pond and think. There were so many
strange things in the world, it seemed as if he
would never have done thinking about them, not if
he lived to be a hundred.</p>

<p>He rested his elbows on his knees and sat
staring at the pond. Overhead the trees
were whispering; behind him, in and out of
their holes the rabbits whisked; far off he could
hear the twitter of a swallow; the foxglove was
dead, the bracken was turning brown, the cones
from the fir trees were lying on the ground.
As he watched, a strange thing happened. Slowly
and slowly the pond lengthened out and out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
stretching away and away until it became a rivera
long river that went on and on, right down
the woods, past the great black firs, past the little
cottage that was a ruin and only lived in now and
then by a stray gipsy or a tired tramp, past the
setting sun, till it dipped into space beyond.
Then many little boats came sailing towards
Willie, and one stopped quite close to where
he sat, just as if it were waiting for him. He
looked at it well; it had a snow-white sail and
a little man with a drawn-sword for a figure-head.
A voice that seemed to come from nowhere
asked</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Willie?" Just as if he understood
he answered back</p>

<p>"Not yet,not quite, dear Queen, but I shall be
soon. I should like to wait a little longer."</p>

<p>"No, no, come now, dear child; they are all
waiting for you." So he got up and stepped into
the boat, and it put out before he had even time to
sit down. He looked at the rushes as the boat cut
its way through them; he saw the hearts of the
lilies as they lay spread open on their great wide
leaves; he went on and on beneath the crimson
sky towards the setting sun, until he slipped into
space with the river.</p>

<p>He saw land at last far on a-head, and as he
drew near it he understood whither the boat was
bound. All along the shore there were hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and hundreds of dolls crowding down to the
water's edge, looking as if they had expected
him. They stared at him with their shining
round eyes; but he just clasped his little goat
tighter and closer, and sailed on nearer and nearer
to the land. The dolls did not move; they stood
still, smiling at him with their painted lips, then
suddenly they opened their painted mouths and
put out their painted tongues at him; but still he
was not afraid. He clasped the goat yet a little
closer, and called out, "Apple-blossom, I am
waiting; are you here?" Just as he had expected,
he heard Apple-blossom's voice answering from
the back of the toy-town</p>

<p>"Yes, dear brother, I am coming." So he
drew close to the shore, and waited for her. He
saw her a long way off, and waved his hand.</p>

<p>"I have come to fetch you," he said.</p>

<p>"But I cannot go with you unless I am bought,"
she answered, sadly, "for now there is a wire spring
inside me; and look at my arms, dear brother;"
and pulling up her pink muslin sleeves, she showed
him that they were stuffed with sawdust. "Go
home, and bring the money to pay for me," she
cried, "and then I can come home again." But
the dolls had crowded up behind, so that he might
not turn his boat round. "Straight on," cried
Apple-blossom, in despair; "what does it matter
whether you go backwards or forwards if you only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
keep straight when you live in a world that is
round?"</p>

<p>So he sailed on once more beneath the sky that
was getting grey, through all the shadows that
gathered round, beneath the pale moon, and the
little stars that came out one by one and watched
him from the sky.</p>

<p>I saw him coming towards the land of story-books.
That was how I knew about him, dear
children. He was very tired and had fallen asleep,
but the boat stopped quite naturally, as if it knew
that I had been waiting for him. I stooped, and
kissed his eyes, and looked at his little pale face,
and lifting him softly in my arms, put him into this
book to rest. That is how he came to be here for
you to know. But in the toy-land Apple-blossom
waits with the wire spring in her breast and the
sawdust in her limbs; and at home, in the big
house at the end of the village, the tall aunt
weeps and wails and wonders if she will ever see
again the children she loves so well.</p>

<p>She will not wait very long, dear children. I
know how it will all be. When it is quite dark to-night,
and she is sitting in the leather chair with the
high back, her head on one side, and her poor long
neck aching, quite suddenly she will hear two voices
shouting for joy. She will start up and listen,
wondering how long she has been sleeping, and
then she will call out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my darlings, is it you?" And they will
answer back</p>

<p>"Yes, it is us, we have come, we have come!" and
before her will stand Willie and Apple-blossom. For
the big doll will have run down, and the wire spring
and the sawdust will have vanished, and Apple-blossom
will be the doll's little girl no more. Then
the tall aunt will look at them both and kiss them;
and she will kiss the poor little goat too, wondering
if it is possible to buy him a new tail. But though
she will say little, her heart will sing for joy. Ah,
children, there is no song that is sung by bird or
bee, or that ever burst from the happiest lips, that
is half so sweet as the song we sometimes sing in
our heartsa song that is learnt by love, and sang
only to those who love us.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WOODEN_DOLL" id="THE_WOODEN_DOLL"></a>THE WOODEN DOLL.</h2>


<p>The wooden doll had no peace. My dears, if
ever you are a doll, hope to be a rag doll, or
a wax doll, or a doll full of sawdust apt to ooze out,
or a china doll easy to breakanything in the world
rather than a good strong wooden doll with a
painted head and movable joints, for that is indeed
a sad thing to be. Many a time the poor wooden
doll wished it were a tin train, or a box of soldiers,
or a woolly lamb, or anything on earth rather than
what it was. It never had any peace; it was taken
up and put down at all manners of odd moments,
made to go to bed when the children went to bed,
to get up when they got up, be bathed when they
were bathed, dressed when they were dressed,
taken out in all weathers, stuffed into their satchels
when they went to school, left about in corners,
dropped on stairs, forgotten, neglected, bumped,
banged, broken, glued together,anything and
everything it suffered, until many a time it said
sadly enough to its poor little self, "I might as well
be a human being at once and be done with it!"
And then it fell to thinking about human beings;
what strange creatures they were, always going
about, though none carried them save when they
were very little; always sleeping and waking, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
eating and drinking, and laughing and crying, and
talking and walking, and doing this and that and
the other, never resting for long together, or seeming
as if they could be still for even a single day.
"They are always making a noise," thought the
wooden doll; "they are always talking and
walking about, always moving things and doing
things, building up and pulling down, and making
and unmaking for ever and for ever, and never are
they quiet. It is lucky that we are not all human
beings, or the world would be worn out in no time,
and there would not be a corner left in which to
rest a poor doll's head."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LIGHT_ON_THE_HILLS" id="THE_LIGHT_ON_THE_HILLS"></a>THE LIGHT ON THE HILLS.</h2>


<p>"I want to work at my picture," he said, and
went into the field. The little sister went
too, and stood by him watching while he painted.</p>

<p>"The trees are not quite straight," she said,
presently, "and oh, dear brother, the sky is not blue
enough."</p>

<p>"It will all come right soon," he answered.
"Will it be of any good?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she said, wondering that he should
even ask, "it will make people happy to look at it.
They will feel as if they were in the field."</p>

<p>"If I do it badly, will it make them unhappy?"</p>

<p>"Not if you do your very best," she answered;
"for they will know how hard you have tried. Look
up," she said suddenly, "look up at the light upon
the hills," and they stood together looking at all
he was trying to paint, at the trees and the field,
at the deep shadows and the hills beyond, and
the light that rested upon them.</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful world," the girl said. "It is a
great honour to make things for it."</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful world," the boy echoed sadly.
"It is a sin to disgrace it with things that are
badly done."</p>

<p>"But you will do things well?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"I get so tired," he said, "and long to leave off
so much. What do you do when you want to do
your best,your very, very best?" he asked,
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I think that I am doing it for the people I
love," she answered. "It makes you very strong
if you think of them; you can bear pain, and walk
far, and do all manner of things, and you don't get
tired so soon."</p>

<p>He thought for a moment. "Then I shall paint
my picture for you," he said; "I shall think of you
all the time I am doing it."</p>

<p>Once more they looked at the hills that seemed
to rise up out of the deep shadows into the light,
and then together they went home.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a great sorrow came to the boy.
While the little sister slept, she wandered into
another world, and journeyed on so far that she lost
the clue to earth, and came back no more. The
boy painted many pictures before he saw the field
again, but in the long hours, as he sat and worked,
there came to him a strange power that answered
more and more truly to the longing in his heartthe
longing to put into the world something of
which he was not ashamed, something which should
make it, if only in the person of its meanest,
humblest citizen, a little happier or better.</p>

<p>At last, when he knew that his eye was true and
his touch sure, he took up the picture he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
promised to paint for the dear sister, and worked
at it until he was finished.</p>

<p>"This is better than all he has done before," the
beholders said. "It is surely beautiful, for it makes
one happy to look at it."</p>

<p>"And yet my heart ached as I did it," the boy
said, as he went back to the field. "I thought of
her all the time I worked,it was sorrow that gave
me power." It seemed as if a soft voice, that spoke
only to his heart, answered back</p>

<p>"Not sorrow but love, and perfect love has all
things in its gift, and of it are all things born save
happiness, and though that may be born too"</p>

<p>"How does one find happiness?" interrupted
the boy.</p>

<p>"It is a strange chase," the answer seemed to
be; "to find it for one's own self, one must seek it
for others. We all throw the ball for each other."</p>

<p>"But it is so difficult to seize."</p>

<p>"Perfect love helps one to live without happiness,"
his own heart answered to himself; "and
above all things it helps one to work and to wait."</p>

<p>"But if it gives one happiness too?" he asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Ah, then it is called Heaven."</p>

<h2><a name="WRITING_A_BOOK" id="WRITING_A_BOOK"></a>WRITING A BOOK.</h2>


<p>"Let us write a book," they said; "but what
shall it be about?"</p>

<p>"A fairy story," said the elder sister.</p>

<p>"A book about kings and queens," said the
other.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the brother, "let's write about
animals."</p>

<p>"We will write about them all," they cried
together. So they put the paper, and pens, and
ink ready. The elder sister took up a fairy story
and looked at it, and put it down again.</p>

<p>"I have never known any fairies," she said,
"except in books; but, of course, it would not do
to put one book inside anotheranyone could do
that."</p>

<p>"I shall not begin to-day," the little one said,
"for I must know a few kings and queens before I
write about them, or I may say something foolish."</p>

<p>"I shall write about the pig, and the pony, and
the white rabbit," said the brother; "but first I
must think a bit. It would never do to write a
book without thinking."</p>

<p>Then the elder sister took up the fairy story
again, to see how many things were left out, for
those, she thought, would do to go into her book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
The little one said to herself, "Really, it is no good
thinking about kings and queens until I have known
some, so I must wait;" and while the brother was
considering about the pig, and the pony, and the
white rabbit, he fell asleep.</p>

<p>So the book is not written yet, but when it is we
shall know a great deal.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SANDY_CAT" id="THE_SANDY_CAT"></a>THE SANDY CAT.</h2>


<p>The sandy cat sat by the kitchen fire. Yesterday
it had had no supper; this morning
everyone had forgotten it. All night it had caught
no mice; all day as yet it had tasted no milk. A
little grey mouse, a saucerful of milk, a few fish or
chicken bones, would have satisfied it; but no grey
mouse, with its soft stringy tail behind it, ran across
the floor; no milk was near, no chicken bones, no
fish, no anything. The serving-maid had been
washing clothes, and was hanging them out to dry.
The children had loitered on their way to school,
and were wondering what the master would say to
them. The father had gone to the fair to help a
neighbour to choose a horse. The mother sat
making a patchwork quilt. No one thought of the
sandy cat; it sat by the fire alone and hungry.</p>

<p>At last the clothes were all a-drying, the children
had been scolded, and sat learning a lesson for the
morrow. The father came from the fair, and the
patchwork quilt was put away. The serving-maid
put on a white apron with a frill, and a clean cap,
then taking the sandy cat in her arms, said,
"Pussy, shall we go into the garden?" So they
went and walked up and down, up and down the
pathway, till at last they stopped before a rose tree;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the serving-maid held up the cat to smell the roses,
but with one long bound it leaped from her arms
and awayawayaway.</p>

<p>Whither?</p>

<p>Ah, dear children, I cannot tell, for I was not
there to see; but if ever you are a sandy cat
you will know that it is a terrible thing to be
asked to smell roses when you are longing for a
saucerful of milk and a grey mouse with a soft
stringy tail.</p>

<p>He had journeyed a long way, and was very
tired. It seemed like a dream when he
stood up after a sleep in the field, and looked over
the wall, and saw the garden, and the flowers, and
the children playing all about. He looked at the
long road behind him, at the dark wood and the
barren hills; it was the world to which he
belonged. He looked at the garden before him, at
the big house, and the terrace, and the steps that
led down to the smooth lawnit was the world
which belonged to the children.</p>

<p>"Poor boy," said the elder child, "I will get you
something to eat."</p>

<p>"But where did he come from?" the gardener
asked.</p>

<p>"We do not know," the child answered; "but he
is very hungry, and mother says we may give him
some food."</p>

<p>"I will take him some milk," said the little one;
in one hand she carried a mug and with the other
she pulled along her little broken cart.</p>

<p>"But what is he called?" asked the gardener.</p>

<p>"We do not know," the little one answered;
"but he is very thirsty, and mother says we may
give him some milk."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is he going?" asked the gardener.</p>

<p>"We do not know," the children said; "but he
is very tired."</p>

<p>When the boy had rested well, he got up saying,
"I must not stay any longer," and turned to go on
his way.</p>

<p>"What have you to do?" the children asked.</p>

<p>"I am one of the crew, and must help to make
the world go round," he answered.</p>

<p>"Why do we not help too?"</p>

<p>"You are the passengers."</p>

<p>"How far have you to go?" they asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, a long way!" he answered. "On and on
until I can touch the sun."</p>

<p>"Will you really touch it?" they said,
awestruck.</p>

<p>"I dare say I shall tire long before I get there,"
he answered sadly. "Perhaps without knowing it,
though, I shall reach it in my sleep," he added.
But they hardly heard the last words, for he was
already far off.</p>

<p>"Why did you talk to him?" the gardener said.
"He is just a working boy."</p>

<p>"And we do nothing! It was very good of him
to notice us," they said, humbly.</p>

<p>"Good!" said the gardener in despair. "Why,
between you and him there is a great difference."</p>

<p>"There was only a wall," they answered.
"Who set it up?" they asked curiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, the builders, of course. Men set it up."</p>

<p>"And who will pull it down?"</p>

<p>"It will not want any pulling down," the man
answered grimly. "Time will do that."</p>

<p>As the children went back to their play, they
looked up at the light towards which the boy was
journeying.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we too shall reach it some day," they
said.</p>

<p>He picked a buttercup, and held it up to her
chin. "Do you like butter?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Butter!" she exclaimed. "They are not made
into butter. They are made into crowns for the
Queen; she has a new one every morning."</p>

<p>"I'll make you a crown," he said. "You shall
wear it to-night."</p>

<p>"But where will my throne be?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It shall be on the middle step of the stile by
the corn-field."</p>

<p>So when the moon rose I went out to see.</p>

<p>He wore a red jacket and his cap with the
feather in it. Round her head there was a wreath
of buttercups; it was not much like a crown. On
one side of the wreath there were some daisies,
and on the other was a little bunch of blackberry-blossom.</p>

<p>"Come and dance in the moonlight," he said;
so she climbed up and over the stile, and stood in
the corn-field holding out her two hands to him.
He took them in his, and then they danced round
and round all down the pathway, while the wheat
nodded wisely on either side, and the poppies
awoke and wondered. On they went, on and on
through the corn-field towards the broad green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
meadows stretching far into the distance. On and
on, he shouting for joy, and she laughing out so
merrily that the sound travelled to the edge of the
wood, and the thrushes heard, and dreamed of
Spring. On they went, on and on, and round and
round, he in his red jacket, and she with the wild
flowers dropping one by one from her wreath. On
and on in the moonlight, on and on till they had
danced all down the corn-field, till they had crossed
the green meadows, till they were hidden in the
mist beyond.</p>

<p>That is all I know; but I think that in the far far
off somewhere, where the moon is shining, he and
she still dance along a corn-field, he in his red
jacket, and she with the wild flowers dropping from
her hair.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_POOR_LITTLE_DOLL" id="THE_POOR_LITTLE_DOLL"></a>THE POOR LITTLE DOLL.</h2>


<p>It was a plain little doll that had been bought
for sixpence at a stall in the market-place. It
had scanty hair and a weak composition face, a
calico body and foolish feet that always turned
inwards instead of outwards, and from which the
sawdust now and then oozed. Yet in its glass eyes
there was an expression of amusement; they
seemed to be looking not at you but through you,
and the pursed-up red lips were always smiling at
what the glass eyes saw.</p>

<p>"Well, you <i>are</i> a doll," the boy said, looking up
from his French exercise. "And what are you
staring at me foris there anything behind?" he
asked, looking over his shoulder. The doll made
no answer. "And whatever are you smiling for?"
he asked; "I believe you are always smiling. I
believe you'd go on if I didn't do my exercise till
next year, or if the cat died, or the monument
tumbled down." But still the doll smiled in silence,
and the boy went on with his exercise. Presently
he looked up again and yawned. "I think I'll go
for a stroll," he said, and put his book by. "I
know what I'll do," he said, suddenly; "I'll take
that doll and hang it up to the apple tree to scare
away the sparrows." And calling out, "Sis, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
taken your doll; I'm going to make a scarecrow of
it," he went off to the garden.</p>

<p>His sister rushed after him, crying out, "Oh, my
poor doll! oh, my dear little doll! What are you
doing to it, you naughty boy?"</p>

<p>"It's so ugly," he said.</p>

<p>"No, it is not ugly," she cried.</p>

<p>"And it's so stupid,it never does anything but
smile,it can't even grow,it never gets any
bigger."</p>

<p>"Poor darling doll," Sis said, as she got it once
more safely into her arms, "of course you can't
grow, but it is not your fault, they did not make any
tucks in you to let out."</p>

<p>"And it's so unfeeling. It went smiling away
like anything when I could not do my French."</p>

<p>"It has no heart. Of course it can't feel."</p>

<p>"Why hasn't it got a heart?"</p>

<p>"Because it isn't alive. You ought to be sorry
for it, and very, very kind to it, poor thing."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it always smiling for?"</p>

<p>"Because it is so good," answered Sis, bursting
into tears. "It is never bad-tempered; it never
complains, and it never did anything unkind," and,
kissing it tenderly, "you are always good and
sweet," she said, "and always look smiling, though
you must be very unhappy at not being alive."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_VIOLETS" id="THE_VIOLETS"></a>THE VIOLETS.</h2>


<p>The sun came out and shone down on the
leafless trees that cast hardly any shadows
on the pathway through the woods.</p>

<p>"Surely the Spring is coming," the birds said;
"it must be time to wake the flowers."</p>

<p>The thrush, and the lark, and the linnet sang
sweetly. A robin flew up from the snow, and
perched upon a branch; a little ragged boy at the
end of the wood stopped and listened.</p>

<p>"Surely the Spring is coming," he too said;
"and mother will get well."</p>

<p>The flowers that all through the Winter had
been sleeping in the ground heard the birds, but
they were drowsy, and longed to sleep on. At last
the snowdrops came up and looked shiveringly
about; and a primrose leaf peeped through the
ground, and died of cold. Then some violets
opened their blue eyes, and, hidden beneath the
tangle of the wood, listened to the twittering of the
birds. The little ragged boy came by; he saw
the tender flowers, and, stooping down, gathered
them one by one, and put them into a wicker
basket that hung upon his arm.</p>

<p>"Dear flowers," he said, with a sigh, as if loth
to pick them, "you will buy poor mother some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
breakfast," and, tying them up into little bunches,
he carried them to the town. All the morning he
stood by the road-side, offering his flowers to the
passers-by, but no one took any notice of him; and
his face grew sad and troubled. "Poor mother!"
he said, longingly; and the flowers heard him, and
sighed.</p>

<p>"Those violets are very sweet," a lady said as
she passed; the boy ran after her.</p>

<p>"Only a penny," he said, "just one penny, for
mother is at home." Then the lady bought them,
and carried them to the beautiful house in which
she lived, and gave them some water, touching
them so softly that the poor violets forgot to long
for the woods, and looked gratefully up into her
face.</p>

<p>"Mother," said the boy, "see, I have brought
some bread for your breakfast. The violets sent
it to you," and he put the little loaf down before
her.</p>

<p>The birds knew nothing of all this, and went on
singing till the ground was covered with flowers,
till the leaves had hidden the brown branches of
the trees, and the pathway through the woods was
all shade, save for the sunshine that flecked it with
light.</p>

<p>They were all very sad, and the girl in the pink
frock was crying bitterly, for they had been
to the woods, and on the way home the wooden
horse had fallen over on one side and broken off
his head.</p>

<p>"Don't cry so, pray don't cry so," the little one
said, as she knelt down in front of her sister,
and tried to kiss her.</p>

<p>"And oh, sister," said the brother, "it would
have been far worse if he had lost his tail too.
Besides, perhaps he does not mind much; it is not
as if he were alive."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," sobbed the tall girl. "But when you

terrible thing to lose your head, even if it is only
wooden."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RAINBOW-MAKER" id="THE_RAINBOW-MAKER"></a>THE RAINBOW-MAKER.</h2>


<p>The children stood under an archway. Behind
them was the blue sky; in front of them the
clear, still lake that wandered and wound about the
garden; above their heads the leaves of a tree
whispered and told strange stories to the breeze.</p>

<p>"Poor tree! it is sighing for the blossoms the
wind has carried away," they said to each other,
and they looked back at the garden. "And, poor
flowers, too," they said, "all your bright colours
are gone, and your petals lie scattered on the
ground; to-morrow they will be dead." "Ah, no,"
the flowers sighed, "the rainbow-maker will gather
them up, and once more they will see the sun."
Before the children could answer, a tall fair maiden
came down the pathway. They could see her plainly
in the twilight. Her eyes were dim with gathering
tears, but on her lips there was a smile that came
and went and flickered round her mouth. All
down her back hung her pale golden hair; round
her neck was a kerchief of many colours; her dress
was soft and white, and her snowy apron was
gathered up in one hand. She looked neither to
the right nor to the left. She did not utter a single
word; and the children could hear no sound of her
footstep, no rustling from her dress. She stooped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and picking up the fading petals, looked at them
tenderly for a moment, while the tears fell slowly
down her cheeks; but the smile hovered round her
mouth; for she knew that they would shine again
in the sight of their beloved sun. When her apron
was quite full, she turned round and left the garden.
Hand-in-hand the children followed. She went
slowly on by the side of the lake, far, far away
across the meadows and up the farthest hill, until
at last she found her home behind a cloud just
opposite the sun. There she sat all through
the summer days making rainbows. When the
children had watched her for a long long time, they
went softly back to their own home. The rainbow-maker
had not even seen them.</p>

<p>"Mother," they said one day, "we know now
where the colours go from the flowers. See, they
are there," and as they spoke they thought of the
maiden sitting silently at work in her cloud-home.
They knew that she was weeping at sending forth
her most beautiful one, and yet smiling as she
watched the soft archway she had made. "See, they
are all there, dear mother," the children repeated,
looking at the falling rain and the shining sun, and
pointing to the rainbow that spanned the river.</p>

<p>"Ohohoh!" she cried, "I have burnt my
tongue."</p>

<p>"Eat it slowly," said the good little sister. <i>She</i>
took up her porridge carefully, and after blowing it
very gently, and waiting for a minute or two while
it cooled, ate it, and found it very nice.</p>

<p>"I shall not eat mine until it is quite cold," said
Totsey, getting cross.</p>

<p>"Then it will be nasty," said the good little

<p>"Oh, dear," said Totsey, "if I eat it too hot it
burns me, and if I eat it too cold it's nasty. What
shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Take it as I do mine," said the good little sister.
"It is the right way."</p>

<p>"There are two wrong ways and only one right
way; it isn't fair," sighed the naughty little girl.
"And, oh! my porridge is so nasty." Then she
asked, "Did you ever eat your porridge too hot
and burn your tongue?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the good little sister; "I never
ate my porridge too hot and burnt my tongue."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you ever eat your porridge when it was

never ate my porridge when it was quite cold and
very nasty."</p>

<p>"Well, I have," said Totsey; "and so I know
about two things that you do not know about."
And the naughty little sister got up and walked

about many things.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PROUD_BOY" id="THE_PROUD_BOY"></a>THE PROUD BOY.</h2>


<p>There was once a very proud boy. He
always walked through the village with his
eyes turned down and his hands in his pockets.
The boys used to stare at him, and say nothing;
and when he was out of sight, they breathed freely.
So the proud boy was lonely, and would have had
no friends out of doors if it had not been for two
stray dogs, the green trees, and a flock of geese
upon the common.</p>

<p>One day, just by the weaver's cottage, he met
the tailor's son. Now the tailor's son made more
noise than any other boy in the village, and when
he had done anything wrong he stuck to it, and
said he didn't care; so the neighbours thought
that he was very brave, and would do wonders
when he came to be a man, and some of them
hoped he would be a great traveller, and stay long
in distant lands. When the tailor's son saw the
proud boy he danced in front of him, and made
faces, and provoked him sorely, until, at last, the
proud boy turned round and suddenly boxed the
ears of the tailor's son, and threw his hat into the
road. The tailor's son was surprised, and, without
waiting to pick up his hat, ran away, and sitting
down in the carpenter's yard, cried bitterly. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
a few minutes, the proud boy came to him and
returned him his hat, saying politely</p>

<p>"There is no dust on it; you deserved to have
your ears boxed, but I am sorry I was so rude as
to throw your hat on to the road."</p>

<p>"I thought you were proud," said the tailor's
son, astonished; "I didn't think you'd say thatI
wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are not proud?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not."</p>

<p>"Ah, that makes a difference," said the proud
boy, still more politely. "When you are proud,
and have done a foolish thing, you make a point of
owning it."</p>

<p>"But it takes a lot of courage," said the tailor's
son.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no," answered the proud boy; "it only
takes a lot of cowardice not to;" and then turning
his eyes down again, he softly walked away.</p>

<h2><a name="SEEKING_THE_VIOLETS" id="SEEKING_THE_VIOLETS"></a>SEEKING THE VIOLETS.</h2>


<p>All the wood had been blue with violets, but
now they were nearly gone. The birds sang
louder and louder to keep them and to call them
back, but soon there was not a violet left in all
the wood from end to end. The snowdrops died,
and the primrose faded, the cowslips and blue-bells
vanished, the thorn grew white with blossom,
the wild honeysuckle filled the wood with its
fragrance, and soon the fruit began to ripen.</p>

<p>The blackbirds and the swallows and the chaffinches,
and all the birds they knew, gathered round
the garden trees and bushes, and forgot the woods,
until suddenly one day they espied a little child.
She was sitting on a chair under a tree; she had a
little table before her and a pink ribbon round her
hat; she was eating fruit with a large silver spoon.
The birds were afraid, and held aloof until a
sparrow chirped and the child looked up, and
when they saw how blue her eyes were, they sang
out bravely and fluttered round her, thinking that
she had brought them news from the violets. But
she never looked up again, though the birds
crowded on to the branch above her, and perched
upon the table, and rubbed their little beaks against
her plate. She just held on her hat with one hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and with the other went on taking up fruit with a
silver spoon.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear child," a swallow twittered, "perhaps
you do not know what is written in your eyes; so
many of us carry secrets that we ourselves know
last of all."</p>

<h2><a name="MIDSUMMER-NIGHT" id="MIDSUMMER-NIGHT"></a>MIDSUMMER-NIGHT.</h2>


<p>The children were very much puzzled what to
do, for it was Midsummer-night, and they
knew that there was a dream belonging to it; but
how to come across it they could not tell. They
knew that the dream had something to do with
fairies, a queen, and all manner of lovely things;
but that was all. At first they thought they would
sit up with the doors and windows open, and the
dog on the steps ready to bark if he saw anything
unusual. Then they felt sure that they could not
dream while they were wide-awake, so three of
them went to bed, and one dozed in a corner of the
porch, with her clothes on. Presently the dog
barked, and two children in their night-gowns ran
out to see, and one took off her night-cap and looked
out of window; but it was only old Nurse coming
back from a long gossip with the village blacksmith's
wife and mother-in-law. So the dog looked
foolish, and Nurse was angry, and put them all to
bed without any more ado.</p>

<p>"Oh," they cried, "but the fairies, and the queen,
and the flowers! What shall we do to see them?"</p>

<p>"Go to sleep," said Nurse, "and the dream may
come to you;you can't go to a dream," she
added, for you see she was just a peasant woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and had never travelled far, or into any land but
her own.</p>

<p>So the children shut their eyes tightly and went
to sleep, and I think that they saw something, for
their eyes were very bright next morning, and one of
them whispered to me, softly, "The queen wore a
wreath of flowers last night, dear mother, and, oh,
she was very beautiful."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_KITE" id="THE_KITE"></a>THE KITE.</h2>


<p>It was the most tiresome kite in the world,
always wagging its tail, shaking its ears,
breaking its string, sitting down on the tops of
houses, getting stuck in trees, entangled in hedges,
flopping down on ponds, or lying flat on the grass,
and refusing to rise higher than a yard from the
ground.</p>

<p>I have often sat and thought about that kite, and
wondered who its father and mother were. Perhaps
they were very poor people, just made of
newspaper and little bits of common string knotted
together, obliged to fly day and night for a living,
and never able to give any time to their children or
to bring them up properly. It was pretty, for it
had a snow-white face, and pink and white ears;
and, with these, no one, let alone a kite, could help
being pretty. But though the kite was pretty, it
was not good, and it did not prosper; it came to a
bad end, oh! a terrible end indeed. It stuck itself
on a roof one day, a common red roof with a
broken chimney and three tiles missing. It stuck
itself there, and it would not move; the children
tugged and pulled and coaxed and cried, but still it
would not move. At last they fetched a ladder,
and had nearly reached it when suddenly the kite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
started and flew awayright away over the field
and over the heath, and over the far far woods, and
it never came back againnevernever.</p>

<p>Dear, that is all. But I think sometimes that
perhaps beyond the dark pines and the roaring sea
the kite is flying still, on and on, farther and farther
away, for ever and for ever.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHILDREN_AND_THE_GARLAND" id="THE_CHILDREN_AND_THE_GARLAND"></a>THE CHILDREN AND THE GARLAND.</h2>


<p>"To-morrow is May-day," the children said;
"the birds must call us very early, and we
will go to the woods and make a garland." And in
the morning, long before the sun had looked over the
tops of the houses into the village street, they were
far away in the woods.</p>

<p>"I will give them some roses as they come
back," the gardener said. "They shall put them
among the spring flowers, as a swallow among the
thrushes, to show that summer is on its way."</p>

<p>When the children had made their garland and a
posy for each one of them, they went singing all
down the village street, over the grey stone bridge,
beyond the hayricks, and past the houses on the
hill-side.</p>

<p>In one of the houses there was a pale little child
with a sad, thin face. "Mother," he said, "here
are some children with a garland. Will it be
summer when they have gone by?" He called
after them as they went on, "Come back, oh,
come back again!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we will come back," they answered, but
they went on their way singing. All through the
day he waited for them, but they did not come;
and at last, when it was evening, the mother took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
him up into her arms to carry him to his bed.
Suddenly he heard the children singing in the
distance. "Oh, mother," he exclaimed, "they are
coming;" and he watched till they came up the
hill again and stood before him. "But where is
your garland?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We gave it to lame Mary, the postman's wife,
for she is always longing to see the fields," they
answered; "but these roses are for you, dear little
boy; they are all for you," and putting them into
his hands they went back to the village.</p>

<p>"You are very tired," the child said to the roses;
"all your leaves are drooping. Poor roses, perhaps
you are lonely away from the garden; but you shall
sleep near me, and there is a star rising up in the
sky; it will watch us all through the night." Then
the child nestled down in his white bedhe and
his little warm heart, in which there was love for all
things. While he slept the roses looked at his pale
little face and sighed, and presently they stole
softly on to his cheeks and rested there. The
children saw them still there when the summer was
over; when the garland was quite dead, and lame
Mary longed for the fields no more.</p>

<h2><a name="TOMMY" id="TOMMY"></a>TOMMY.</h2>


<p>Tommy was sitting on the bench near the
end of the lane. By his side was a basin
tied up in a cotton handkerchief; in the buttonhole
of his coat there was a sprig of sweet-william.
The girls from the big house came and stood still
in front of him, staring at him rudely, but he did
not speak.</p>

<p>"Tommy, are you tired?" they asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," Tommy answered, crossly, "I'm very
tired, and father's working in the fields, and I have
got to take him his dinner before I go to the fair."</p>

<p>"Why don't the servants take it?"</p>

<p>"Servants!" said Tommy scornfully; "we've no
servants. We are not rich people!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to be rich?" the eldest
sister asked, while the two little ones walked slowly
round Tommy, looking at the feather in his hat;
he had put it there so that he might look smart
when he went on to the village.</p>

<p>"No, it's too expensive," said Tommy, shaking
his head; "rich people have to buy such a lot of
things, and to wear fine clothes, and they can't have
dinner in the fields."</p>

<p>"My father has his dinner in a room," said the
girl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's because he's rich," answered Tommy,
"and people would talk if he didn't; rich people
can't do as they like, as poor can."</p>

<p>"And my father lives in a big house," the girl
went on, for she was vulgar, and liked to boast.</p>

<p>"Yes, and it takes up a lot of room; my father's
got the whole world to live in if he likes; that's
better than a house."</p>

<p>"But my father doesn't work," said the girl,
scornfully.</p>

<p>"Mine does," said Tommy, proudly. "Rich
people can't work," he went on, "so they are
obliged to get the poor folk to do it. Why, we
have made everything in the world. Oh! it's a
fine thing to be poor."</p>

<p>"But suppose all the rich folk died, what would
the poor folk do?"</p>

<p>"But suppose all the poor folk died," cried
Tommy, "what would the rich folk do? They can
sit in carriages, but can't build them, and eat
dinners, but can't cook them." And he got up and
went his way. "Poor folk ought to be very kind
to rich folk, for it's hard to be the like of them,"
he said to himself as he went along.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SWALLOWS" id="THE_SWALLOWS"></a>THE SWALLOWS.</h2>


<p>There were some children in the north looking
at the swallows flying south. "Why are
they going away?" the little one asked.</p>

<p>"The summer is over," the elder sister answered,
"and if they stayed here they would be starved and
die of cold, and so, when the summer goes, they
journey south."</p>

<p>"Our mother and sisters are in the south," the
little one said, as they looked after the birds.
"Dear little swallows, tell mother that we are
watching for her!" But they were already flying
over the sea. The chilly winds tried to follow, but
the swallows flew so swiftly they were not overtaken;
they went on, with the summer always
before them. They were tired many a time; once
they stayed to rest upon the French coast, and
once, in the Bay of Biscay, they clung to the rigging
of a ship all through the night, but in the morning
they went on again.</p>

<p>Far away in the south, two English children were
looking from the turret window of an old castle.</p>

<p>"Here are the swallows," they said; "perhaps
they have come from England. Dear swallows,
have you brought us a message?" they asked.</p>

<p>"It was very cold, we had no time for messages;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
and we must not lose the track of summer," the
swallows twittered, and they flew on till they
reached the African shore.</p>

<p>"Poor little swallows," said the English children,
as they watched the ship come into port that was
to take them back to their own land; "they have
to chase the summer and the sun, but we do not
mind whether it is summer or winter, for if we only
keep our hearts warm, the rest does not matter."</p>

<p>"It is very good of the swallows to come to us,"
the elder sister said, in the next spring, when she
heard their first soft twitter beneath the eaves, "for
the summer is in many places, and we are so far
from the south."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is very good of them to come," the
children answered; "dear little swallows, perhaps
they love us!"</p>

<h2><a name="SMUT" id="SMUT"></a>SMUT.</h2>


<p>Now, this story is quite true. Once upon a
time there was a cat called Mr. Puff; he
lived in a grand house, quite close to the Turkish
Embassy. A lord and a lady and several servants
lived with Mr. Puff; he was very kind to them,
letting them do in all things as they liked, and
never sending them away or keeping the house to
himself. One day Mr. Puff, being out in the rain,
found a poor little kitten, covered with mud, and
crying bitterly: so Mr. Puff took the kitten between
his teeth, carried it home, and set it down on the
drawing-room hearth-rug. The lord and the lady
had the kitten washed, and gave it food, and called
it Smut. Then Smut went and sat him down on
the lord's writing-table.</p>

<p>When Smut grew to be a cat, but before he was
yet a large one, the lord and the lady thought
awhile, and spoke, "We have a dear friend," they
said, "and he is catless; therefore, if Mr. Puff will
agree, we will take Smut to him as a present."
And Mr. Puff agreed. So Smut was put into a
birdcage, for there was nothing else to serve him
for a travelling carriage, and taken to the dear
friend's house. The dear friend had a little girl
with golden hair, and when she saw Smut, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
cried out for joy, and said, "Never before did I see
a dicky-bird with a furry coat, a long tail, and little
white teeth." But Smut shook his head, as if to
say, "I am not a dicky-bird, sweet maid, but only
a four-legged cat;" then they opened the birdcage
door, and he walked out, waving his tail.</p>

<p>Now, when Smut grew up, his gravity and dignity
made all who knew his history wonder, and few
could believe that he had once been a dirty kitten,
covered with mud, glad to accept the charity of Mr.
Puff. When a year had gone, or perhaps even a
longer time, there was a great war in Turkey, and
terrible battles were fought. Then Smut looked
very anxious, and went quite bald, and his coat fell
off in little patches; but none could tell why. At
last he died, and the little girl wept sorely, and all
who had known him grieved and lamented.</p>

<p>And when Smut had been sleeping only a little
while beneath the lilac tree, accident revealed
that, instead of a lowly foundling, he had been of
high degree, for the little vagrant Mr. Puff had
found was no less a person than the Turkish
Ambassador's coachman's wife's cat's kitten.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BAD_GIRL" id="THE_BAD_GIRL"></a>THE BAD GIRL.</h2>


<p>She was always called the bad girl, for she had
once, when she was very little, put out her
tongue at the postman. She lived alone with her
grandmother and her three brothers in the cottage
beyond the field, and the girls in the village took no
notice of her. The bad girl did not mind this, for
she was always thinking of the cuckoo clock. The
clock stood in one corner of the cottage, and every
hour a door opened at the top of its face, and a
little cuckoo came out and called its name just the
same number of times that the clock ought to have
struck, and called it so loudly and in so much haste
that the clock was afraid to strike at all. The bad
girl was always wondering whether it was worse for
the clock to have a cupboard in its forehead, and a
bird that was always hopping in and out, or for the
poor cuckoo to spend so much time in a dark little
prison. "If it could only get away to the woods,"
she said to herself, "who knows but its voice might
grow sweet, and even life itself might come to it!"
She thought of the clock so much that her grandmother
used to say</p>

<p>"Ah, lassie, if you would only think of me sometimes!"
But the bad girl would answer</p>

<p>"You are not in prison, granny dear, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
have not even a bee in your bonnet, let alone a bird
in your head. Why should I think of you?"</p>

<p>One day, close by the farm, she saw the big girls
from the school gathering flowers.</p>

<p>"Give me one," she said; "perhaps the cuckoo
would like it." But they all cried, "No, no!" and
tried to frighten her away. "They are for the
little one's birthday. To-morrow she will be seven
years old," they said, "and she is to have a crown
of flowers and a cake, and all the afternoon we shall
play merry games with her."</p>

<p>"Is she unhappy, that you are taking so much
trouble for her?" asked the bad girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; she is very happy: but it will be her
birthday, and we want to make her happier."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because we love her," said one;</p>

<p>"Because she is so little," said another;</p>

<p>"Because she is alive," said a third.</p>

<p>"Are all things that live to be loved and cared
for?" the bad girl asked, but they were too busy to
listen, so she went on her way thinking; and it
seemed as if all things roundthe birds, and bees,
and the rustling leaves, and the little tender wild
flowers, half hidden in the grassanswered, as she
went along</p>

<p>"Yes, they are all to be cared for and made
happier, if it be possible."</p>

<p>"The cuckoo clock is not alive," she thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
"Oh, no; it is not alive," the trees answered;
"but many things that do not live have voices,
and many others are just sign-posts, pointing the
way."</p>

<p>"The way! The way to what, and where?"</p>

<p>"We find out for ourselves;we must all find
out for ourselves," the trees sighed and whispered
to each other.</p>

<p>As the bad girl entered the cottage, the cuckoo
called out its name eleven times, but she did not
even look up. She walked straight across to the
chair by the fireside, and kneeling down, kissed her
granny's hands.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PINK_PARASOL" id="THE_PINK_PARASOL"></a>THE PINK PARASOL.</h2>


<p>The pink parasol had tender whalebone ribs
and a slender stick of cherry-wood. It lived
with the wilful child in the white-house, just beyond
the third milestone. All about the trees were
green, and the flowers grew tall; in the pond
behind the willows the ducks swam round and
round and dipped their heads beneath the water.</p>

<p>Every bird and bee, every leaf and flower, loved
the child and the pink parasol as they wandered in
the garden together, listening to the birds and
seeking the shady spots to rest in, or walking up
and down the long trim pathway in the sunshine.
Yet the child tired of it all, and before the summer
was over, was always standing by the gate, watching
the straight white road that stretched across
the plain.</p>

<p>"If I might but see the city, with the busy streets
and the eager crowds," he was always saying to
himself.</p>

<p>Then all that lived in the garden knew that the
child would not be with them long. At last the
day came when he flung down the pink parasol,
and, without even one last look at the garden, ran
out at the gate.</p>

<p>The flowers died, and the swallows journeyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
south; the trees stretched higher and higher, to
see the child come back across the plain,
but he never came. "Ah, dear child!" they
sighed many a time, "why are you staying? and
are your eyes as blue as ever; or have the sad
tears dimmed them? and is your hair golden still?
and your voice, is it like the singing of the birds?
And your heartoh! my dear, my dear, what is in
your heart now, that once was so full of summer
and the sun?"</p>

<p>The pink parasol lay on the pathway, where the
child left it, spoilt by the rain, and splashed by the
gravel, faded and forgotten. At last, a gipsy lad,
with dark eyes, a freckled face, and little gold rings
in his ears, came by; he picked up the pink
parasol, hid it under his coat, and carried it to the
gipsy tent. There it stayed till one day the cherry-wood
stick was broken into three pieces, and the
pink parasol was put on the fire to make the water
boil for the gipsy's tea.</p>

<p>The little sisters went into the room to play at
ball.</p>

<p>"We must be careful not to wake the white
cat," the tall one said, softly.</p>

<p>"Or to spoil the roses," the fat one whispered;
"but throw high, dear sister, or we shall never hit
the ceiling."</p>

<p>"You dear children," thought the white cat,
"why do you come to play here at all? Only just
round the corner are the shady trees, and the birds
singing on the branches, and the sunshine is
flecking the pathway. Who knows but what, out
there, your ball might touch the sky? Here you
will only disturb me, and perhaps spoil the roses;
and at best you can but hit the ceiling!"</p>

<p>"Come and have a ride," the big brother said.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," the little one answered;
"the horse's mouth is wide open."</p>

<p>"But it's only wooden. That is the best of a
horse that isn't real. If his mouth is ever so wide
open, he cannot shut it. So come," and the big
brother lifted the little one up, and dragged him
about.</p>

<p>"Oh, do stop!" the little one cried out in terror;
"does the horse make that noise along the floor?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And is it a real noise?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is," the big brother answered.</p>

<p>"But I thought only real things could make real
things," the little one said; "where does the
imitation horse end and the real sound begin?"</p>

<p>At this the big brother stood still for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>"I was thinking about real and imitation things,"
he said presently. "It's very difficult to tell which
is which sometimes. You see they get so close
together that the one often grows into the other,
and some imitated things become real and some
real ones become imitation as they go on. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
should say that you are a real coward for not
having a ride."</p>

<p>"No, I am not," the little one laughed; and,
getting astride the wooden horse, he sat up bravely.
"Oh, Jack, dear," he said to his brother, "we will
always be glad that we are real boys, or we too
might have been made with mouths we were never
able to shut!"</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DUCK_POND" id="THE_DUCK_POND"></a>THE DUCK POND.</h2>


<p>So little Bridget took the baby on her right arm
and a jug in her left hand, and went to the
farm to get the milk. On her way she went by the
garden-gate of a large house that stood close to the
farm, and she told the baby a story:</p>

<p>"Last summer," she said, "a little girl, bigger
than you, for she was just able to walk, came to
stay in that houseshe and her father and mother.
All about the road just here, the ducks and the
chickens from the farm, and an old turkey, used to
walk about all the day long, but the poor little
ducks were very unhappy, for they had no pond to
swim about in, only that narrow ditch through
which the streamlet is flowing. When the little
girl's father saw this, he took a spade, and worked
and worked very hard, and out of the ditch and the
streamlet he made a little pond for the ducks, and
they swam about and were very happy all through
the summer days. Every morning I used to stand
and watch, and presently the garden-gate would
open, and then the father would come out, leading
the little girl by the hand, and the mother brought
a large plateful of bits of broken bread. The little
girl used to throw the bread to the ducks, and they
ran after it and ate it up quickly, while she laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
out with glee, and the father and the mother
laughed too just as merrily. Baby, the father had
blue eyes, and a voice that you seemed to hear with
your heart.</p>

<p>"The little girl used to feed the chickens too,
and the foolish old turkey that was so fond of her
it would run after her until she screamed and was
afraid. The dear father and the little girl came
out every morning, while the black pigs looked
through the bars of the farm-yard gate and grunted
at them, as if they were glad, and I think the ducks
knew that the father had made the pond, for
they swam round and round it proudly while he
watched them, but when he went away they seemed
tired and sad.</p>

<p>"The pond is not there now, baby, for a man
came by one day and made it into a ditch again;
and the chickens and the ducks from the farm are
kept in another place.</p>

<p>"The little girl is far away in her own home,
which the father made for her, and the dear father
lives in his own home tooin the hearts of those
he loved."</p>

<p>That was the story that Bridget told the baby.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DONKEY_ON_WHEELS" id="THE_DONKEY_ON_WHEELS"></a>THE DONKEY ON WHEELS.</h2>


<p>There was once a poor little donkey on wheels.
It had never wagged its tail, or tossed its head,
or said, "Hee-haw!" or tasted a tender thistle. It
always went about, anywhere that anyone pulled
it, on four wooden wheels, carrying a foolish knight,
who wore a large cocked hat and a long cloak,
because he had no legs. Now, a man who has no
legs, and rides a donkey on wheels, has little cause
for pride; but the knight was haughty, and seldom
remembered his circumstances. So the donkey
suffered sorely, and in many ways.</p>

<p>One day the donkey and the knight were on the
table in front of the child to whom they both
belonged. She was cutting out a little doll's frock
with a large pair of scissors.</p>

<p>"Mistress," said the knight, "this donkey tries
my temper. Will you give me some spurs?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir knight," the child answered. "You
would hurt the poor donkey; besides, you have no
heels to put them on."</p>

<p>"Cruel knight!" exclaimed the donkey. "Make
him get off, dear mistress; I will carry him no
longer."</p>

<p>"Let him stay," said the child, gently; "he has
no legs, and cannot walk."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why did he want spurs?"</p>

<p>"Just the way of the world, dear donkey; just
the way of the world."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed the donkey, "some ways are very
trying, especially the world's;" and then it said
no more, but thought of the fields it would never
see, and the thistles it would never taste.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BOY_AND_LITTLE_GREAT_LADY" id="THE_BOY_AND_LITTLE_GREAT_LADY"></a>THE BOY AND LITTLE GREAT LADY.</h2>


<p>She was always called the "little great lady,"
for she lived in a grand house, and was very
rich. He was a strange boy; the little great
lady never knew whence he came, or whither he
went. She only saw him when the snow lay deep
upon the ground. Then in the early morning he
swept a pathway to the stable in which she had
once kept a white rabbit. When it was quite
finished, she came down the steps in her white
dress and little thin shoes, with bows on them, and
walked slowly along the pathway. It was always
swept so dry she might have worn paper shoes
without getting them wet. At the far end he
always stood waiting till she came, and smiled and
said, "Thank you, little boy," and passed on. Then
he was no more seen till the next snowy morning,
when again he swept the pathway; and again the
little great lady came down the steps in her dainty
shoes, and went on her way to the stable.</p>

<p>But at last, one morning when the snow lay white
and thick, and she came down the steps as usual,
there was no pathway. The little boy stood leaning
on a spade, his feet buried deep in the snow.</p>

<p>"Where is your broom? and where is the pathway
to the rabbit house?" she asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"The rabbit is dead, and the broom is worn out,"
he answered; "and I am tired of making pathways
that lead to empty houses."</p>

<p>"But why have you done it so long?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You have bows on your shoes," he said;
"and they are so thin you could not walk over the
snow in themwhy, you would catch your death of
cold," he added, scornfully.</p>

<p>"What would you do if I wore boots?"</p>

<p>"I should go and learn how to build ships, or
paint pictures, or write books. But I should not
think of you so much," he said.</p>

<p>The little great lady answered eagerly, "Go and
learn how to do all those things; I will wait till
you come back and tell me what you have done,"
and she turned and went into the house.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," the boy said, as he stood watching
for a moment the closed door; "dear little great
lady, good-bye." And he went along the unmade
pathway beyond the empty rabbit house.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
